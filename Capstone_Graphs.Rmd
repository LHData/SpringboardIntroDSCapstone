## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
stops_summary_2010_with_pop <- read_csv("~/Learning/Springboard/Introduction to Data Science/Capstone/Data/Output/stops_summary_2010.csv")
#graph it:
ggplot(stops_summary_2010_with_pop, aes(x=ethnicity, y = ethnicity_percent)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = location), stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') + facet_grid(division ~.)

graph_district_distributions <- function(x) {
  stops_summary_2010_with_pop %>% 
    filter(division == unique(stops_summary_2010_with_pop$division)[x]) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=ethnicity, y = ethnicity_percent)) + 
    geom_bar(aes(fill = location), stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +
    ggtitle(unique(stops_summary_2010_with_pop$division)[x])
  
}

graph_district_distributions(1)
graph_district_distributions(2)
graph_district_distributions(3)
graph_district_distributions(4)
graph_district_distributions(5)
graph_district_distributions(6)
graph_district_distributions(7)
graph_district_distributions(8)
graph_district_distributions(9)
graph_district_distributions(10)
graph_district_distributions(11)
graph_district_distributions(12)
graph_district_distributions(13)
graph_district_distributions(14)
graph_district_distributions(15)
graph_district_distributions(16)
graph_district_distributions(17)
graph_district_distributions(18)
graph_district_distributions(19)
graph_district_distributions(20)
graph_district_distributions(21)
graph_district_distributions(22)
graph_district_distributions(23)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
